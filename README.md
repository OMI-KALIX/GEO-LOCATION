# GEO-LOCATION Alert App 

# *Overview*

This is a web-based Geolocation Alert App that tracks the user's real-time location and allows users to set location-based alerts. When the user enters a predefined alert zone, an audio notification (customizable) and vibration alert are triggered.

# *Features*

@ Real-time Location Tracking: Uses the browser's Geolocation API to monitor user movement.

@ Google Maps Integration: Displays the userâ€™s location on a map.

@ Location-based Alerts: Users can add alerts with messages and alert types.

@ Local Storage: Alerts and selected audio tones are stored persistently.

@ Custom Alert Tones: Users can upload their own audio files as alert tones.

@ Vibration Alerts: Supports device vibration when an alert is triggered (if supported by the device).

@ Dark Mode Toggle: Enables a dark mode interface for better usability.

# *Technologies Used*

@ HTML, CSS, JavaScript

@ Google Maps API

@ LocalStorage

Known Issues & Limitations

Works only on browsers that support the Geolocation API.

Custom alert tones are only available during the session (browser restrictions may prevent persistent storage of audio URLs).

Accuracy of location tracking depends on the device and browser.

Future Enhancements

Implement a database backend for persistent storage.

Add a feature to share alerts with other users.

Improve UI with more animations and user-friendly controls.

Support for push notifications.
